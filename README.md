Visual Analogue Scale Component for .NET
========================================

Largely inspired by [SixLetterVariables](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3924835/50151), this is a visual analogue scale component for building experiments in .NET. Visual analogue scales are a standard tool in experimental psychology - see [the wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analog_scale).
